## Acknowledgements
This project was developed by Mohammadmehdi Karami as part of the Modern Control course. Special thanks to Prof. Hamid D. Taghirad for his invaluable guidance and support, as well as to the peers who provided valuable feedback and assistance throughout the course.

## Introduction
The Modern Control Project focuses on the application of advanced control theory techniques to the practical problem of quadcopter stabilization and control. This project utilizes MATLAB to simulate and implement various control strategies to maintain the stability and desired performance of a quadcopter. The MATLAB code provides a comprehensive framework for modeling, simulation, and analysis of the quadcopter's dynamics and control systems.

## Project Overview
The project involves detailed investigations into quadcopter dynamics and control using modern control theory. Here's what you'll find in each folder:
- **Report Folder:** Contains a comprehensive report documenting the theoretical backgrounds, experimental setups, and findings of the project. This report includes mathematical analyses, detailed methodologies, simulation results.
- **Code Folder:** Contains MATLAB scripts and Simulink models used for modeling, simulation, and implementation of control strategies.
For more detailed information, please refer to the respective README files located in the `report` and `code` folders of this repository.

## Installation and Usage
