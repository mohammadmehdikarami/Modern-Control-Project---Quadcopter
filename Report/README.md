# Report Folder: Quadcopter Dynamics and Control

This folder contains a detailed report documenting the theoretical background, methodologies, and findings of the project. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the quadcopter's dynamics and control systems.

## Report Contents

**File:** `report.pdf`  
**Description:** This comprehensive report covers the following topics:

1. **System Introduction:**  
   We introduce the quadcopter system, examining its applications and key components.

2. **Mathematical Modeling:**  
   We derive the mathematical model of the quadcopter, considering both its kinematics and dynamics, and calculate its state-space representation.

3. **State Transition Matrix:**  
   We calculate the state transition matrix and analyze the responses of both linear and nonlinear models to sample inputs.

4. **Observability and Controllability:**  
   We evaluate the observability and controllability of the system using the observability and controllability matrices and transform the model to its Jordan form.

5. **Transfer Function and Realization:**  
   We derive the transfer function from the state-space representation and then realize a state-space representation from the transfer function. Additionally, we assess the system's stability.
